          <img src="te.jpg" class="img1">
          <p>Tidal energy is one of the oldest forms of energy generation. It is a renewable form of energy that converts the natural rise and fall of the tides into electricity. Tides are caused by the combined effects of gravitational forces exerted by the Moon, the Sun, and the rotation of the Earth.Tidal energy presents an evolving technology with tremendous potential. However, it can only be installed along coastlines. Coastlines often experience two high tides and two low tides on a daily basis. The difference in water levels must be at least 5 meters high to produce electricity.

		      <h2>Advantages of Tidal Energy</h2>
			  <ul type="i">
			     <li>It is renewable.</li>
			     <li>It is green.</li>
				 <li>It is predictable.</li>
				 <li>It is effective at low speeds.</li>
				 <li>It has a long lifespan.</li>
				 <li>It reduces foreign importation of fuel.</li>
			   </ul>

		      <h2>Disadvantages of Tidal Energy</h2>
			  <ul type="i">
			     <li>It still has some environmental effects.</li>
				 <li>It is an intermittent energy source.</li>
				 <li>It should be close to land.</li>
				 <li>It is not cost-effective.</li>
				 <li>It requires long gestation time.</li>
			  </ul>

		      <h2>Uses of Tidal Energy</h2>
			  <p>The biggest and main use of Tidal Energy is in the generation of Electricity and most of the research is being done towards this end. Tidal Electricity is cheap, long-lived and non-polluting in nature. It has benefits over solar and wind power in the sense that it is predictable in nature and also has a higher load factor. The other usage of Tidal Energy is pretty low compared to Geothermal Energy which is primarily used for Heating Purposes.
