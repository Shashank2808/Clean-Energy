          <p>Water is pretty powerful stuff! You know this if you have stood in a flowing stream and felt the water rushing past you. Or, if you've gone whitewater rafting down a raging river. Even mere images of a place like Niagara Falls help you appreciate just how strong moving water is. This is not a new observation, and water has been used to produce different forms of energy for a very long time. When electricity is generated from flowing water, this is called hydroelectric energy, and the prefix 'hydro' refers to water.
		     Hydroelectric energy is considered a renewable energy resource because it's an energy resource that regenerates in a short time period. You can think of this like the hair on your head. If you get a bad haircut that you don't like, you don't have to worry about it too much because it will grow back in a reasonable amount of time. However, if you lose an arm, you certainly can't regenerate that! Your hair is a renewable resource, whereas your arm is a non-renewable resource.
			 Sunlight, wind and heat generated from the earth are similar types of renewable energy resources. Just like you can't stop water from flowing, you can't stop the sun from shining or the wind from blowing. The resource 'renews' itself as it is used, and unlike things such as minerals and metals, does not occur on Earth in a limited supply.

		      <h2>Uses of Hydroelectric Energy</h2>
			  <p>Hydropower is energy collected from flowing water that's converted into electricity or used to power machinery. Hydropower has been around for centuries, used to turn millwheels or drive early industrial machinery, but in modern use it typically refers to electrical generation. Today hydropower generates more electricity in the United States than any other renewable energy source, and the Department of Energy's Wind and Water Power Program promotes and accelerates its use throughout the country. For businesses, hydro offers recruiting benefits alongside a cost-effective and plentiful source of green energy.
