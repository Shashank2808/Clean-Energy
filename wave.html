          <p>The topic of renewable energy is an evergreen subject, especially, in a world dominated by fossil fuels. Renewable energy is widely talked about in the contemporary world because it is unlimited, which means it’s sustainable and does not emit greenhouse gasses that are detrimental to the environment and human health. A classic example of renewable energy is wave energy.
             The pursuit of wave energy dates all the way back in 1799 when Girard and his sons filed a patent to utilize wave energy in Paris. The modern pursuit of wave energy went all the way to the Empire of Japan in 1940 when it was developed by Yoshio Masuda, a former Japanese naval commander, who was regarded as the father of modern wave energy technology. Wave energy only gained popularity after the 1963 oil crisis when Professor Stephen Hugh Salter invented the eponymous Salter duck wave energy device that was able to convert 90% of wave motion into electricity, generating 80% efficiency.

		      <h2>Uses of Wave Energy</h2>
			  <p>Wave power is the capture of energy of wind waves to do useful work – for example, electricity generation, water desalination, or pumping water. A machine that exploits wave power is a wave energy converter (WEC).
                  Wave power is distinct from tidal power, which captures the energy of the current caused by the gravitational pull of the Sun and Moon. Waves and tides are also distinct from ocean currents which are caused by other forces including breaking waves, wind, the Coriolis effect, cabbeling, and differences in temperature and salinity.
