          <p>Fuels that have been extracted from plants and crops are known as biofuels. Of these, the most commonly extracted and used one is Bioethanol or simply Ethanol and Biodiesel. It is blended with gasoline and can be used as an alternative fuel for your car. Plant based fuels comes form renewable source, can be grown anywhere and have lower carbon emissions as compared to fossil fuels. Biofuels not only help a struggling economy by providing jobs but also helps in reducing greenhouse gases up to much extent by emitting less pollution.
             As prices of crude oil are soaring day by day, most people are switching to biofuels to save money and reduce their  dependance on oil. Biofuels are produced from wheat, corn, soyabeans and sugarcane which can be produced again and again on demand, so they are sustainable. Though biofuels have many advantages over their counterparts, but there are some other complicating aspects that we need to look at.

		      <h2>Uses of Biofuel Energy</h2>
			  <p>When using the work fuel, the tendency is the think of the material in question as a liquid for use in automobiles, trucks, and possibly planes. The truth is, biofuels are looked at as a means of replacing ALL of human energy needs from home heating to vehicle fuel to electricity generation. The basic concept is that if we use as much product as we grown, then our net impact on the environment should be negligible if not zero. This article covers a few of the current uses of biofuels, a few of proposed uses, and tries to quantify (or at least mention) the environmental impact.
