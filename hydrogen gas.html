          <img src="h.jpg" class="img1">
          <p>Hydrogen can be produced from diverse, domestic resources. Currently, most hydrogen is produced from fossil fuels, specifically natural gas. Electricity—from the grid or from renewable sources such as wind, solar, geothermal, or biomass—is also currently used to produce hydrogen. In the longer term, solar energy and biomass can be used more directly to generate hydrogen.

		      <h2>Uses of Hydrogen Gas Energy</h2>
			  <p>The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) began using liquid hydrogen in the 1950s as a rocket fuel, and NASA was one of the first to use hydrogen fuel cells to power the electrical systems on spacecraft.Hydrogen fuel cells produce electricity by combining hydrogen and oxygen atoms. This combination results in an electrical current. A fuel cell is two to three times more efficient than an internal combustion engine running on gasoline.The interest in hydrogen as an alternative transportation fuel is based on its potential for domestic production, its use in fuel cells for zero-emission electric vehicles, and the fuel cell vehicle's potential for high efficiency.
