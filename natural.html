          <img src="natgas.jpg" class="img1">
          <p> Natural gas is a mixture of gases which are rich in hydrocarbons. All these gases (methane, nitrogen, carbon dioxide etc) are naturally found in atmosphere. Natural gas reserves are deep inside the earth near other solid & liquid hydrocarbons beds like coal and crude oil.
              Natural gas is not used in its pure form; it is processed and converted into cleaner fuel for consumption. Many by-products are extracted while processing of natural gas like propane, ethane, butane, carbon dioxide, nitrogen etc, which can be further used.

		      <h2>Uses of Natural Gas</h2>
			  <p>Natural gas is mainly used as fuel for generating electricity and heat. Natural gas in compressed form is used as fuel for vehicles which is known as CNG. It is used as fuel for boilers and air conditioners worldwide. This is used for making fertilizers also, mainly ammonia.
                 A green field project is going on in Russia to produce LNG to run aircrafts. Russia, USA and Canada are major producers & consumers. For transporting, two variants are used - LNG for cross countries exchange and CNG for domestic purpose.
